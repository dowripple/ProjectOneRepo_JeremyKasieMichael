## notebooks Folder

2. WorldHeightData_Clean.ipynb - notebook for cleaning the world height data, creates the 2 height files
3. OlympicData_Analysis - notebook for the project analysis, and chart generation
4. olympicHeights.ipynb - notebook for scrap (do not read, unless you want a headache)
5. WorldHeightData_StatFun.ipynb - having fun with world height data, correlation matrix and ANOVA, but not part of the story!

## Project Description
These 3 Jupyter notebooks explore height as it relates to Olympic athletes and the global average.  We sliced the data numerous ways to look at it from different angles.  Are all sports the same?  Are all events the same?  Is the height relationship between a country's population and their athletes significant?  These notebooks attempt to answer these questions and more.
